<p class="text-center"><img src="../images/quest/market.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>       
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   At the Lighthaven Bank (south from the temple) find Kihlor Dul. Say "Work" and then "Register" to him. He will ask if "you want to register". Answer "Yes" and he will give you a registry letter, which you must deliver to one of the two merchants in Lighthaven. If you choose to give the letter to Sigfried you will be rewarded with Experience Points and if you give the letter to Rolph you will be rewarded with Gold Pieces. In any case, go to one of the merchants and say "Letter". They will give a letter that you must deliver to Lord Sunrock at the city of Windhowl.

  </p>
  <h2>Attention: this is a timed quest. So move on....</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of going to Windhowl, go to the Thieves' town (through Brigands cave) and find Asarr. Talk to him and say "Report". He will thank you and tell you to report to Lord Sunrock fast, before he notices something. Go back to Windhowl and find Lord Sunrock (he is located at the house north of the temple entrance) and say "Report" to him. He will thank you and reward you with 750 Gold Pieces or 6,000 Experience Points. Leave and continue leveling. After you level up twice return to Lord Sunrock. Talk to him and he will accuse you for betraying him.

  </p>

  
     <h2>Attention:</h2> 
     <p> 
     If you return the Diamond he will forgive you. If you want to continue the Evil Path don't do so! Leave and go back to Asarr. He will apologize -cause Sunrock learn it- and he will ask if want to "chicken out" or not.
   </p>

   <h2>Attention: Do not answer "Yes" if you want to stay at the Evil Path</h2>
   <p>
    Say "No" to him (-17 karma) and he will send you to find The Lurker at Windhowl. Go to Windhowl and find The Lurker (located south of the temple) and say "Market of Shadows". He will direct you next door to Ttayh Mark. Say "Black Market" and you will now have access to the world-famous black market.

   </p>
    <p>
      Note #1: The Black Market is open only at night time. 
      Note #2: The items that you can find at the Black Market are not the same every day and are different to every user.

    </p>
