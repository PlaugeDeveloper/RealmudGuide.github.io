      <h1>Merchant Letter Quest</h1>
<p class="text-center"><img src="../images/quest/scroll.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>       
      <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
   At the Lighthaven Bank (south from the temple) find Kirlor Dul. Say "Work" and then "Register" to him. He will ask if "you want to register". Answer "Yes" and he will give you a registry letter, which you must deliver to one of the two merchants in Lighthaven. If you choose to give the letter to Sigfried you will be rewarded with Experience Points and if you give the letter to Rolph you will be rewarded with Gold Pieces. In any case, go to one of the merchants and say "Letter". They will give a letter that you must deliver to Lord Sunrock at the city of Windhowl.
   </p>
  <p>
  Attention: this is a timed quest, so go directly to Windhowl. When you arrive, find Lord Sunrock (he is located at the house north of the temple entrance). Say "Report" and he will thank you and reward you with either 750 Gold Pieces or 6,000 Experience Points -- Depending on who you started the quest with.
  </p>
  <p>Note #1: You must be at least 5 level to start this quest.</p> 

  <p>Note #2: You can do this quest twice, once registering with Rolph and once with Sigfried.</p>
