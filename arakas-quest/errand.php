      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
  Near Lighthaven temple, there is an NPC (dressed in red clothes) called Lighthaven Samaritan. Talk to him and he will ask you if you have any questions to ask.

Answer "Yes" and then say "Errand" then . He will give you your first quest, to kill 15 rats at the temple dungeon. Kill them, then return to him and say "Errand" again.

You will rewarded with 2.500 Experience Points. Note: When you are level 1 it's a little difficult to "handle" rats. At the first level of the temple dungeon (in a room to the west), you will find an NPC called Nevanis.

Say "Heal" to him and he will cure your wounds. Stay near him and whenever you need help, just say "Heal" to him.
