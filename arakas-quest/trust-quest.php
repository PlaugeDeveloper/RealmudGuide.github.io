      <h1>Trust Quest</h1>
<p class="text-center"><img src="../images/quest/trust.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>       
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   At the 4th level of the Lighthaven temple dungeon, you will find a demon named Balork. Kill him (+4 karma) and with his last words upon dying he "marks you" (with the "Balork Mark"). Now go to Old Hermit (through Brigand's cave) and say "Trust". He will say that you have to earn his trust and he will direct you to his daughter Mirak Nira (located near the entrance of Windhowl temple). Talk to her and say 3 times "Old Hermit" and then "Trust".

  </p>
  <p>
    To earn her trust you must kill 100 goblins (not counting the goblins you have killed so far). Go to the Arakas Goblin Camp (best place to find a lot of Goblins) and kill 100 of them. When done return Mirak Nira and say "Trust". She will reward you with a ring of trust (+8 karma).
  </p>
   <p>
     Attention: If you equip the Ring of Trust, the Old Hermit will not let you advance in the Trust Quest, but you will not be stuck permanently - to fix it, you have to go back in the quest and kill Balork again. So, it is not a bug, it is a test of trust - if the player equips the ring even if he got warned not to do it, they fail the test of trust and have to re-start the quest.. Head to Old Hermit and say "Trust".

   </p>
    <p>
      He will take the ring and reward you with an Amulet of Precision and 4000 experience points. Say "Miracle", "Wizardry" and he will tell you about a mage named Liurn Clar who lives at Windhowl. Head to Windhowl and find Liurn Clar (located at the mage tower). Say "Portal" and follow the instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
      He will ask for 10000 gold pieces and sign some papers (so that he is not responsible for anything that happens during your trip...that's comforting). Say "Send", "Yes" (you must be at least 25 level) and he will teleport near the fountain of Silversky.
