      <h1>Goblin Fever Quest</h1>
<p class="text-center"><img src="../images/quest/goblin.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p> 
      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     NW of Lighthaven, find a yellow goblin named Dorken Rotsmell. Kill him and one of the following NPCs will get sick 1. If Geena is sick from Goblin fever Geena is located in Halam's Inn (LH Tavern). Talk to her and she will tell you that she is sick. She will ask you to find Mushn who is located at the WH Fields. Find him and talk to him, he will give you a Healing Leaf. Go back to Geena and click on her. She will take the leaf and thank you. She also tells you to speak to Halam for your reward. Click on Halam and he will give you a Girdle of Courage or a Ring of the Bear.</p>
    <p>
    2. If Kalastor is sick from Goblin fever Kalastor is located at a house in the Lighthaven square. Talk to him and he will ask you to find the Lurker at Windhowl. Go to Windhowl, find The Lurker (located in a house south from the temple) and talk to him. He will offer you an Elixir of Purity for 800 Gold Pieces. Buy it (say "Yes") and return to Kalastor. Click on him and he takes the Elixir. He will thank you and reward you with (1500 + (200 * current level)) Gold Pieces.</p>
    <p>
    3. If Murmuntag is sick from Goblin fever Murmuntag is located at the Lighthaven square (a friendly Orc). He will ask you for a pouch of yellow powder. You can find yellow powder by killing Araf Kul or Roshnak Tul, both located at Arakas Orc camp. Attention: Araf Kul and Roshnak Tul are difficult for low levels. We recommend that you don't do this quest until level 15. And get some potions :-) The yellow powder is a little difficult to be found and maybe you will have to kill him more than once in order to find it. When you find it, return to Murmuntag and click on him. He will be cured and reward you with (1000 + (100 * current level)) Experience Points.</p> 
    <p>    Note #1: An easy way to kill Araf Kul and Roshnak Tul if you are a fighter (or if you use melee combat) is to approach him slowly, killing all the Orcs that you find in your way. Don't hesitate to backstep a little bit, if you are overwhelmed. First clear the whole area and when he is alone, attack him. On the other hand, if you are a mage, use an earth/fire based spell for the damage and Lesser Drain for recovering your lost HP. Note #2: You can do this quest as many times as you want.</p>
