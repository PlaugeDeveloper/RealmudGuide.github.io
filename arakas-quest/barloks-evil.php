      <h1>Balork's Evil Quest</h1>
   <p class="text-center"><img src="../images/quest/balork.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p> 
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    In Lighthaven, locate Kalastor (in a house near the square) and say "Balork". Now go to the 4th level of the temple dungeon and find Balork. Say "Evil" and he will give you the password (nightingale). Attention: Once he gives you the password, Balork will attack you. Don't kill him, just run away. Go back to Kalastor and say "Nightingale" and he will ask you to perform some missions. Say "Mission" and he will ask you to go to Edgar Gimplestratten and collect some money he owes Kalastor. Go to Edgar (located south from the square) and say "Kalastor".
  </p>
 <p>
   He will attack you, so kill him (-4 karma). Upon his death, you will receive the money that he owes to Kalastor. Go back to Kalastor and he will ask if you brought him the money. Say "Yes" (-19 karma) and he will mention that he has some more missions for you. In order to get your second mission you must have finished the Black Market quest. When it is done, say "Mission" to Kalastor and he will direct you to an old friend of him, named Shadeen. He will also tell you that he lives at Raven Dust island and he will send you to find Liurn Clar (located at Windhowl mage tower).

 </p>
  <p>
    Find him and say "Teleport". Liurn says that Lord Sunrock will not let him and he mentions something about an Orc at the north that maybe can help. Go to 3rd level of Jarko Caves and find an Orc called Renegade Orc Leader. Say "Teleport", "Scribble-papers" and he will tell you that he will trade the scroll with a "big glum sword". * you must be in mission for Kalastor for this to work*.
  </p>
  <h2>Attention: If you answer "yes" without having the sword, he will attack you.</h2>
  <p>
   The Orc Leader is looking for a Gloomblade. Go to Lance Silversmith (you must be at least 16 level) and say "Gloomblade". He will ask for: 
  </p>
  <h3>a Nightsword, + a Ring of Darkness, + a Scroll of Enchantment and 10000 gold pieces.</h3>
  
  <p>
    You can find Nightsword from Nightsword quest. Ring of Darkness from Griroesh or from the locked chest near Griroesh Scroll of Enchantment from Scroll of Enchantment quest Also, consult the items chart for more information and drops Collect all the above and go back to Lance Silversmith. Say "Make Gloomblade" and head to Renegade Orc Leader. Say "Scribble-papers", "Yes" and he will give you a Scroll of Silversky. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Note: Rumors says that the password which Balork gives you, is random. We tried it many times and always we get the same password. (We say it, Souldust says it, so it's over)
