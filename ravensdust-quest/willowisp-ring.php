      <h1>Willowisp Ring Quest</h1>

      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   Go to Tarantula pond and search for an NPC called Evelyn (spawns near the pond at random locations). She only speaks at night time. Say "Willowisp Ring" to her and she will ask for a pouch of willowbark from the Save the little tree quest and a Iron ring. You can find an iron ring in Arakas chests. Once you have them return to her and say again "Willowisp Ring" then "Yes" and she will give you the Willowisp Ring.

  </p>
  <p>
   Note #1: You can do this quest as many times as you want
  Note #2: There is a small bug in this quest. If you have more than one pouch of willow bark or iron ring in your backpack, then Evelyn will act as you don't have them and she will ask you to bring them to her. So if you do, just drop them and leave only one pouch and one ring in your backpack. Then you can complete the quest.

  </p>
