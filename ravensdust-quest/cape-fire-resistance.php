      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    To do this quest, you must have completed the Audience to Bane Blackblood quest. In Bane's castle, find him and say "Ingredients". He will ask for a Manastone and a Pouch of Blue Cohosh. Consult the item chart to find more info about what monsters drop these. Return to Bane with the ingredients and say "Ingredients" and then "Yes" and he will trade them for a Blood Dagger and 5.000 Experience Points.

  </p>
  <p>
    Next go to Silversky and find Baldric Silverknife (east of the pot shop). Say "Something" and he will ask for a Blood Dagger and a Gleaming Shard to give you his drum. The Gleaming shard is a drop by Bandaged Horrors (in the RD Crypt, consult the item chart to find more info about it). Go back to Baldric and say "Something" and then "Yes" and he will hand over his drum (Baldric's Drum). Continue on to Thorbin Wildheart in the Silversky Tavern. Say "Baldric" and he will ask you to give him the drum so he can bury it [I guess Baldric is a lousy musician ].

  </p>
  <p>
    Say "Yes" and as a reward you will get 3.000 Experience points and one of the following: a Cape of Fire resistance or an Empty Beer Mug (oh yeah!).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note #1: You can't equip the Blood Dagger
  </p>
  <p>
    Note #2: You can do this quest as many times as you want
