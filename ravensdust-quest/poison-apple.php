      <h2>Description</h2>

  Before you left Arakas, Kalastor mentioned that a friend of his, Shadeen is located in Raven's Dust. Go to Bane Blackblood's castle (through connector cave) and down to his castle dungeon (Skullkeep dungeon). Search for Shadeen (located in a small room to the east). When you find her say "Kalastor" and she will direct you to Elysana Blackrose (located at Silversky town). Go to Elysana and say "Poison", "Yes" and she will ask for kraanian eyes, wax apple and sapphire gem. Say "Sapphire Gem" and she says that King Theodore probably has, then say "Wax Apple" and she directs you to Samuel. Finally say " Kraanian Eyes" and she sends you to Zhakar.

   If you haven't completed the Death Jester quest then he will ask you to do so. For the Wax Apple he will ask you to bring him 10 wasp wax and 1000 gold pieces. Death Stringers drop Wasp Wax or consult the items chart for more information and drops. Collect 10 wasp wax and return to Samuel. Say "Wax Apple", "Yes" and he will give you the apple. 

  </p>

    Now go to Zhakar (located at the Tower of Sorcery) and say "Kraanian Eyes. He will tell you that Nightblades steal them and he will direct you to Bane Blackblood. Go to Bane Blackblood and say "Kraanian Eyes" (Bane Blackblood will speak to you only if you have completed the Audience to Bane Blackblood quest). He will sell them to you for 5000 gold pieces. Now back to Elysana Blackrose. Say "Poison" and she will tell you to come back after an hour. Wait for a Real-Life Hour and return for your apple. Say again "Poison" and she will give it to you. Go to Bishop Crowbanner (near the castle throne) and say "Give Apple" (-23 karma).

  </p>
  <p>
    Note #1: You can do this quest as many times as you want
  Note #2: Shadeen will talk, only if Bishop Crowbanner is in remission
