      <h1>The Death of Shadeen Quest</h1>   
      <p class="text-center"><img src="../images/death.png" alt="" width="150" height="150"></p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Search for the NPC called Monsignor Damien (west from the bridge that leads to Orc Caves). Say "Shadeen", "No". He will summon some monsters called Shadeen's Masked Assassins. Kill them and talk again to Damien. Say "Help", "Yes" and he will say that you will need to complete 3 quests for him. Say "Gift", "Token", "Abandon" and he will ask for 50000 gold pieces. Say "No" and he will ask for 25000 gold pieces.

  </p>
  <p>
   Say "Yes", "Means" and he will give you a "tightly wrapped scroll". He will also mention that you will need a Blade of Ruin in order to kill Shadeen. Go to Silversky and find Taliron (armor seller near pot shop). Say "Visitor" to him and he will direct you to Belagan (Adriana's assistant (AP trainer )). Say "Visitor" twice to Belagan and he will direct you to Nafuhr Bloodhammer (the armor seller near castle entrance).

  </p>
  <p>
   Say again "Visitor" to Nafuhr and he will send you to Boreas (the potion seller). Once again say "Visitor" and Boreas will direct you to Kiadus (weapon seller at the entrance of the castle). Yep, right guess: "Visitor" again and then "Sister" and he will ask for 2000 gold pieces. Say "Yes", "Sister" and he says that the sister of the visitor is Amandra (located at AP house). Go to her and say (NOT AGAIN !!!) "Visitor".

    Head for the Tower of Sorcery and then go west until you reach the sea. Now south and you will find a small house and Amandra's brother, named Haden. Say to him "Blade of Ruin" and he will attack you. Kill him and you will receive the Blade of Ruin (directly in your backpack). Now you must enchant the Blade. Monsignor Damien mentioned Xanth, he is the one who will enchant your Blade. Head to Blind Man (located in Broken One cave) and say "Xanth" then "Price" and he will enchant your Blade of Ruin (it will become an Elvenbane). Go kill Shadeen now (equip the Elvenbane) then head to Monsignor Damien. Say "Shadeen" then "Reward", "Stoneheim" and he will send you to Zhakar for the ritual. Head for Zhakar and say "Ritual". He will ask for the following items in order to perform the ritual to allow you to go toStoneheim... 

  </p>
  <h2>Items To Complete Ritual</h2>
  <h3>Skeleton Bone from Skeleton Warlocks</h3>
  <h3>Flask of Goblin Blood from Goblin Subchief</h3>
  <h3>Flask of Crystal Water from Dune Raider</h3>
  <h3>Belladonna Berries from Greyleaf</h3>
  <h3>Silver Feather already from Shadeen (Silver Feather quest)</h3>
  <h3>Silver Feather already from Shadeen (Silver Feather quest)</h3>
  <h3>5000 Gold Pieces</h3>

 <p>
   Also, consult the items chart for more information and drops. Once you have turned them in you will have to wait 1 hour before Zhakar will send you to Stoneheim. Note: Nafuhr Bloodhammer will not talk you if you are poor. You must have at least 2k in your <backpack class=""></backpack>
