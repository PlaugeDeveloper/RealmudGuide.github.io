      <h1>The Kraanian Egg Quest</h1> 
   <p class="text-center"><img src="../images/egg.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>      
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Get a kraanian egg from Arakas (by killing Kraanian Milepedes). Take the egg to Zhakar (in the RD Tower of Sorcery) and say "Egg" and then "Yes". He will tell you that you need to wait a bit until the egg hatches. Do 1 Level Up and return to Zhakar. Say "Egg" and he will ask you to find his lost Mana Rod. Go to the Deep One Cave and find the Deep One Boss. Kill him and he will "say" that he gave the Rod to a wizard. You will receive a note in your backpack.

  </p>
  <p>
    Go and find Aloysius Starbolt in the Silversky Palace who will be delighted to sell you the rod for 32.000 Gold Pieces by saying "Deep One" to him. After returning the Mana Rod to Zhakar, do 1 more Level Up, then come back and tell him "Egg". He will tell you that the experiment failed and a monster will appear. Face the Zzartgax that shows up and you will be rewarded with an Ethereal Amulet and 75.000 Experience Points.
  </p>
