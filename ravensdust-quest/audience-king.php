      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
  In the Silversky Palace, find Chamberlain Thomar and say "Audience". He tells you that, in order to talk to the King you must perform a quest. Say "Quest" and then "Yes" and he will ask you to kill 10 Rogue Mages in 30 minutes. You can find Rogue Mages just outside the Silversky gates. When you have killed them, go back to Chamberlain Thomar and say "Quest". As a reward you will be able to talk to the King.

  </p>

  <p>
   Note: If, at some point, King Theodore tells you that in order to talk to him, you have to ask Chamberlain Thomar, go to Thomar again and say "Audience". He'll tell you that, since you have done the quest, you can talk to the King.

  </p>
   <p> 
     If you return the Diamond he will forgive you. If you want to continue the Evil Path don't do so! Leave and go back to Asarr. He will apologize -cause Sunrock learn it- and he will ask if want to "chicken out" or not.
   </p>
