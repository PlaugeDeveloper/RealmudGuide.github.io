       "First of all, it is important to remember that all game accounts and their contents (characters, items…)
       remain sole property of Dialsoft Inc. The players only have the right to access the accounts; this right
       can be removed at any time for any reason or for no reason by a member of the Realmud staff. By creating 
       an account, or buying the access rights to an account, or acquiring these rights in any other way, and
        logging on to the Realmud server, you agree to these terms, as well as the rest of the rules herein."

      <h3>General Rules</h3>

      <h4>The general rules of the Realmud T4C server are as follows:</h4>

   <h4>
      These rules are to be interpreted by the staff of Realmud as they see fit, and are subject to change 
      at very short notice. It is the player’s responsibility to read and be aware of the rules.
 </h4>
      
  <p>
      #1. Any decision a staff member takes is final. If you disagree with rules 1 and/or 2, feel free to contact Shinigami HGM in game, but be sure of your claim. He doesn’t like having his time wasted.
  </p>

  <p>
      #2. All account information must be filled in and valid. This is to help retrieve stolen accounts.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
      #3. The 4th Coming is to be played using common sense. We are a community; keep that in mind, as there are others here to play as well as you, and each and every person is to be considered.
  </p>

  <p>
      #4. Account sharing is allowed, but not supported. Any and all actions performed on a character are deemed character responsible, not by the person behind the screen, and so the character 
      shall be punished, whether it was you behind the screen or not.  
  </p>

  <p>
      #5. As it is not supported, account sharing is at your own risk; if you share an account and lose access to that account (i.e. the other person changes account details) 
      it is your fault, Realmud staff will not return the account(s).
  </p>

   <p>
      #6. Bashing staff is not good for your health or your account.
   </p>
