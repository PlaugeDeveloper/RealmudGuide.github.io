      <h1>Ancient Land  Access Quest</h1>
  
 <p>
   First, go to Kifaelius Venturath in the Hallway before the Oracle. He tells you the story of the Ancient Land and how he can get you there if only he had the six pieces to the Ancient Elemental Armor. To save yourself six trips to him say all six elements while you're there (dark, light, fire, water, earth and air). Now recall to collect the six pieces of armor.
