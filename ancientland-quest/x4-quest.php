      <h1>Max Remort x4 Quest</h1>
   
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
  Before you head to The Beginning NPC, collect three human feet. There are three monsters that drop them. Blaarg Toemangler in the RD Orc caves, just before the exit to the Orc town. Foot Dropper SH is north of Mordenthal's Mountains wedged between the mountains and the Coast. Foot Dropper RD is located West of Tara pond, however she is hidden in the mountains.
  </p>
 <p>
   Once you have three human feet head to The Beginning in the Oracle Chambers. He will teleport you to A Powerful Wizard NPC. Talk to the NPC, but be careful If you do not follow the keywords exactly he might teleport you to Silversky. So click on him and say “human foot” and “proceed” then follow the keywords exactly until he asks you to locate the Keys of Synndor, say “yes” when you are ready to fight.
 </p>
 
 <p>
   You will be teleported to a dungeon area with many Drakonians. Go to the south eastern corner of the dungeon and you'll find Synndor. The best way to kill the Drakonians for the nine Keys is to attack Synndor. In close range (almost melee) he will unleash a monstrous Hurricane-like spell that will do massive damage on the surrounding Drakonians. Keep running up to him and letting him use the spell until you get all the nine keys. If Synndor has not already died then finish him off and take the Stone of the Ancients. Take the stone and keys back to A Powerful Wizard.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Make Sure you talk to synndor Before you kill Him.</h2>

<h3>This is the part where good and evil divide, although both are essentially the same. Talk to A Powerful Wizard and he will ask you to chose your path.</h3>

<h2>Say Evil NPC Niltisar Majiah</h2>

<h2>Good NPC Nomarac Majiah</h2>
 
 <p>
   You'll then be teleported to that twin's realm, be prepared before you get teleported. Monsters have very high dark resist so they cannot be drained. As you run around looking for the seraphs you will spawn a lot of them, so be prepared. Find the twin that you got teleported to and say: “yes,” “brother,” “yes.” The twin will then ask you to find the Seraph in his realm holding the essence of the other brother's karma.
 </p>
 <p>
   Find the Mystress of Chaos/Keeper of Justice and kill her to drop the Good Essence (Green Gem)/Evil Essence (Red Gem). Once you have the essence return to the twin and say “Good/Evil Essence” to him. He will take it and you are done with this part of the quest so you now need to recall and walk back to the Oracle's realm.
 </p> 
 <p>
   You will need roughly 300ac and some healing potions to not be damaged as much by the monsters. Go back to A Powerful Wizard and he will then tell you that you are now ready to 4x. Walk back to The Oracle and speak to The Beginning NPC to start the reborn process. Note: You need to be over level 100 to rebirth as a 4x seraph.
