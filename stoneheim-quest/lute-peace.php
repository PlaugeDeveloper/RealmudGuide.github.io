      <h1>Lute of Peace Quest</h1>
   <p class="text-center"><img src="../images/lute.png" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   At Centaur town, talk to Dionysus Silverstream. Say "Quest", "Lute of Peace", "Recharged". He will ask you to recharge his Lute, say "Yes". Take it and search to find the Ethereal Portal (you have to complete the Ethereal Key quest first). Once you find it, enter it and search to find an NPC called Glaenshenmilandira (it's the only one NPC at Nether Isles, located in a big house at a castle, can't miss it).
  </p>
  <p>
  Say "Lute of Peace" to her and she will ask you at least for 6 Magical Lutes (dropped by Death Jester at Silversky Castle dungeon). Find them and return to Glaenshenmilandira. Say again "Lute of Peace", "Yes" and she will recharge the Lute. You will also be rewarded with 2.000 experience points * your current level.
  </p>
 
 <p>
   Head back to Dionysus Silverstream and say "Lute of Peace". You will be rewarded with 750 experience points * your current level, 2.000 gold pieces * your current level and if you are lucky, a Robe of Heaven.

 </p>
 
 <p>
   Note #1: You can do this quest as many time as you want.
Note #2: Dynosious Silverstream talks to you about this quest only during the night time.
Note #3: At Nether Isles, you will see a monster named Purifier. If you kill him, Glaenshenmilandira
will refuse to talk you. She will ask you to kill Neoflares (as many as the Purifiers you have killed).
When it's done she will talk to you. 
Note #4: Glaenshenmilandira asks for "at least" 6 Magical Lutes to recharge the lute of peace, and only has a 60% chance of succeeding. If she doesn't succeed you don't receive the EXP, and can't return the Lute. For every extra lute you get 5% chance of succeeding. So if you bring 14 lutes you have 100% chance.
