      <h1>Evil Seraph Quest</h1>
   <p class="text-center"><img src="../images/wing4.png" alt="" width="250" height="250"></p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
   At Stonecrest town, search to find an NPC called Julian. Talk to him and say "Work" then "Master". He will send you to Sir Morderthal (located at Sir Mordenthal's castle, NE from Stonecrest). Head to Mordenthal and say "Work", "Dark Knight", "Ogrimar", "Dwindled", "Another", "Dark One", "Makrsh P'Tangh", "Gods", "Followers", "Servants", "Yes", "I Swear Allegiance to Ogrimar".

  </p>
  <p>
  Now that you have sworn allegiance to Ogrimar, you can take your first quest. Say to Mordenthal "Uphold", "Yes", "Vanquishing", "Stronghold", "Oracle", "Key of Ogrimar", "Heart of Destiny", "Fortress", "Chamber of Providence", "Pieces", "Parts" and you will learn about Makrsh P'Tangh and that you must stop him. He will also tell you that the only way to reach Makrsh P'Tangh is through the Oracle. To reach the Oracle Realm you must pass through the Chamber of Providence and through the Heart of Destiny. To enter the Chamber of Providence you need the Key of Ogrimar. For the Key of Ogrimar you will need:
  </p>
 
  <h1 class="text-center">Skull of Ogrimar</h1>
  <h1 class="text-center">Blood of Ogrimar</h1>
  <h1 class="text-center">Bones of Ogrimar</h1>
  <p>
   Now say "Skull of Ogrimar" and he will send you to find Zion Thunderheart (located at Centaur village). Say "Blood of Ogrimar" and he will say to ask his assistant. Say "Assistant" and he says that his assistant is Julian. Now say "Bones of Ogrimar" and he says that you must first have the other 2 parts (Skull &amp; Blood) and then he will tell you about the Bones of Ogrimar.
  </p>
  <h1 class="text-center">Skull of Ogrimar</h1>
  <p>
    Go to Zion Thunderheart (located at Centaur village). Say "Skull of Ogrimar" and he will ask who told it to you. Answer "Mordenthal" then again "Skull of Ogrimar", "Cost" and he will ask for the following items:
  </p>
 <h2>1 Skull of Evil</h2>

<h4>For one Skull of Evil you must take the following items to Oogla Thraaglurh (located at Moon Tug Skraug town) (Keyword: "Skull of Evil", "Yes") (Note: DO NOT make skulls for your next Rebirth. Zion Thunderheart will not accept them):</h4>


<h4>2 Villain Skulls (dropped by Pilferers and Nightcreepers just outside of Stonecrest)</h4>

<h4>1 complete set of the Lost Psalms of Artherk (pages 1-5) (dropped by Pilferers just outside Stonecrest)</h4>
 
 <h4>
  2 Scrolls of Hate (purchased from Shaman Weethgwotha (located at Kahp Leth village) for 5 Mandrakes each (you can buy Mandrakes from Chryseida Yolangda for 2.000 gold pieces)) (Keyword:"Scroll of Hate", "Yes")

 </h4>     

 <h4>15.000 gold pieces</h4>  

 <h2> 1 Crown of Corruption</h2>

 <h4>
   For one Crown of Corruption go to Meltar Winterstorm (located at Thieves Hideout) and say "Crown of Corruption", "Insignificants", "Deserve", "Owns", "Renown", "Increase". He will say that you must increase your renown before he will give you the Crown.
 </h4>

 <h4>
   To increase your renown you must give him gems (see Gems Quest). The amount of the gems that he will take is random (100-400) so pick any gem you found in your way. When he says "Ahh, [chars name]! You honor us with your presence. How may I help you today?" say "Crown of Corruption" and he will give you the crown.

 </h4>

<h2>2 Arcane Spellbooks</h2>
<p>
  Head to Zhakar (located at Tower of Sorcery, Raven Dust) and say "Arcane Spellbook". Zhakar will ask for:
</p>

<h4>10 Arcane Scrolls </h4>
<h4>35.000 gold pieces </h4>
<p>
  Note: It's better to give Zhakar 20 Scrolls (it's the maximum he takes) for each spellbook. I tried with 10 scrolls and we didn't complete the procedure. He said that something went wrong and he had to start over. As many times I tried with 20 scrolls, he always succeeded to create the Arcane Spellbook.
</p>

<p>
  Say "Sweepers" to him and he will summon Sweepers (easy rats) at all levels of his Tower. Kill them and they will drop Arcane Scrolls. When you have enough scrolls, return to Zhakar and say "Arcane Spellbook", "Created", "Yes". You must wait for 15 minutes, until Zhakar completes the Arcane Spellbook.
</p>
<p>
  Take them all back to Zion Thunderheart and just click on him. He will tell you that the Skull of Ogrimar is hidden in a chest at the Temple of Ogrimar (Vargus's castle, N from Stonecrest).</p> 
  <h2>ATTENTION: DO NOT TALK TO VARGUS</h2> <p>until you have the Skull, cause if you talk to him he will hide the Skull and you have to return to Zion Thunderheart (He will mention that Vargus hid it and the skull will re-appear in the chest). Go to Temple of Ogrimar, open the chest and you will find the Skull of Ogrimar.</p>













 <h1 class="text-center">Blood of Ogrimar</h1>
 <h3>
  Go to Stonecrest and talk to Julian. Say "Blood of Ogrimar" and he will direct you to Vargus. Go to Vargus and say "Blood of Ogrimar", "Choice Items" and he will ask for the following items in order to make you the Blood of Ogrimar:
 </h3>

<h2>3 Demonic Bloods</h2>

<h4>For one Demonic Blood take the following to Kwarlgloth (located at Moon Tug Skraugs village (the manastone seller)) (Keyword: "Demonic Blood", "Yes"):

<p>
  Once you collect them all return to Vargus. Just click on him and say "Yes" and he will give you the Blood of Ogrimar.
</p>

<h1 class="text-center">Bones of Ogrimar</h1>

<p>
  Once you have both the Skull and Blood of Ogrimar, return to Sir Mordenthal and say "Bones of Ogrimar". He will tell you that you have only to ask the current holder of the Bones of Ogrimar and he will give them to you.
</p>

<p>
  Head to Stonecrest and talk to Julian (Keyword: "Bones of Ogrimar", "Yes", "Cavern", "Entrance"). He will tell you a story about a man named Venadar and that he found the Bones after falling in a hall. He will also tells you that he climbed out of the hall and traced his steps back to a well, which is located near Khimtesar's house (Khimtesar = Gateway teacher). Head to Khimtesar house and click on the well just outside of the house.

</p>

<p>
  Follow the directions (7 steps west, 20 steps north, the "drop spot" to the hall is exactly in front of the small rock) and you will end up in a small cave. Go down the stairs and head east. You will end up in another cave with a staircase leading down.
</p>

<p>
  Go down the stairs and head as far east as you can go. You will meet an NPC called "A Frightening Beast" (actually is Venadar). Say "Bones of Ogrimar", "Object", "Ring" and he will tell you that someone stole the Bones from him and that the thief left a ring behind. He will refuse to give you the ring, so kill him leave the screen and return. He will appear once again. Just click on him and he will give you an Ancient Ring.
</p>

<p>
  Go back to Sir Mordenthal and click on him. He will direct you to Drardos (located at Silversky town) to learn more about the ring. Head to Drardos and say "Ancient Ring ", "Yes" and he will send you to Brother Thorkas (located at Silversky temple).
</p>

<p>
  Say "Ancient Ring", "Yes", "Master Jeweler" to Thorkas and he will say that the ring is evil. Head back to Drardos and click on him. He will send you to Xanth (Blindman) in order to learn more about the ring. Head to Xanth and say "Ancient Ring", "Yes" to him and he will ask for: 1 Essence of Bloodlust (dropped by Bloodlust)
</p>

<p>
  1 Bloodstone Ring (dropped by Bloodlust or from the Bloodstone Ring quest) Find them and return to Xanth. Say "Ancient Ring" and he will tell you that the Ancient Ring belongs to Sir Mordenthal. Head to Mordenthal (or just double click on the ancient ring and you will be teleported to Mordenthal's castle) and say "Ancient Ring", "Give me the Bones" a few times.

</p>

<p>
  He will act as if he doesn't know what you are saying. Once he asks who told you, answer "Xanth" and then say again "Give me the Bones" and he will give them to you.
</p>

<h1 class="text-center">Key of Ogrimar</h1>

<p>
  Once you have all 3 parts (Skull, Blood and Bones of Ogrimar) go to Sir Mordenthal. Say "Key of Ogrimar", "Yes" and he will assemble you the Key.

<h1 class="text-center">Oracle Zone</h1>

  First you must head to the Chamber of Providence. Go to Sunken Woods (near Gateway Teacher house) and search for two Monoliths/Spires. Go between them across a bridge of water. You will end up on a small island with a dungeon (Chamber of Providence). Go down the dungeon and find a portal. Go through the portal and you will end up in the Heart of Destiny (the center of Stoneheim). Search to find a whirlpool and go through it.

</p>


<p>

In this house you will find many puzzles, traps and mazes. Each area is a different puzzle to solve. After you have completed all of the puzzles and challenges you will get to meet the Oracle (NPC). Talk to him, take his final test, pass it and you will become a Seraph.
